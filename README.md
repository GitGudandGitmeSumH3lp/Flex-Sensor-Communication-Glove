# Development of Multi-Mode Bending Flex Communication System using Arduino Mega with SMS Module
An Arduino-based assistive device for individuals with mobility impairments, using flex sensors for gesture-based communication and SMS alerts.

### ✨ Key Features

* **Gesture-Based Command System:** Translates distinct finger flexions into five pre-programmed commands using strategically placed flex sensors in a glove.
    * The system can signal for "Help," "Food," "Water," "Air," and can toggle lights on and off.
* **Multi-Modal Alerting:** Provides immediate feedback through three different channels to ensure messages are received clearly.
    * **Visual:** Displays the recognized command on a Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) screen.
    * **Auditory:** Plays a corresponding audio message through an onboard speaker and a DFPlayer Mini module
    * **Remote:** Automatically sends an SMS text message to a designated caregiver via a GSM SIM 808 module, ensuring help can be summoned from a distance.
* **Integrated Motion Sensing:** Includes an ADXL355 accelerometer to detect motion, providing an additional layer of data for gesture interpretation and system control.
* **User-Centric Design:** The entire system is specifically engineered to address the communication challenges faced by individuals with mobility impairments and the elderly, aiming to increase their convenience and confidence
